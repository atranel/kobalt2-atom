# Kobalt2 Syntax for Atom

Theme is heavily based on Cobalt2-Atom from wesbos!
I changed some colors and removed unnecessary hardly-visible backgrounds.

An Atom syntax theme based on our old blue friend cobalt. A refined colour scheme that is easy on the eyes.

Pairs well with built-in One Dark UI Theme.
